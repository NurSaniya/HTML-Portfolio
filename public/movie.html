<h2>Top 3 Best movies according to Saniya</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Epic biographical thriller film. Winner of 2023 Golden Globe. </p>
<h3>The Holdovers</h3>
<p>Good comedy drama film. This film shows how human connections that may seem unlikely can be transformative.</p>
<h3>Translator</h3>
<p>A movie that starts semi-uninteresting, foggy, vague laced with unknowingness, but gradually takes beautiful shape, commitment, camaraderie, hidden pledge deep from the heart, backed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim's charismatic acting, superb and haunting photography & filming, supersonic tech and weaponry and moments of intense despair, frustration and anger.</p>
